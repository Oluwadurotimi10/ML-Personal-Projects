# ML-Personal-Projects

### This repo consists majorly of classification and recommendation ML projects. Several ML algorithms were implemented here.
# Some of the projects worked on are;

- Iris Classification: This is a popular classification problem. This is a multiclassification problem, the notebook entails from cleaning of data to EDA to model building to making inference.
- Loan Prediction: This is binary classification problem. I worked on this while taking the loan prediction course on analyticsvidhya. The ntebook is well explantory.
- Plan Crash prediction: This is a multiclassfication problem. ML algorithms like LogisticRegression, Decision Trees, RandomForest e.t.c including Artificial neural netwroks were used in building the model.
- Movie Recommendation: This is a movie recommender system which gave recommendations based on weighted ratings of the movies and the content (i.e storyline, cast, crew etc) of the movie. The Nearest Neighbor item based collaborative filtering was also used to give recommendations.
